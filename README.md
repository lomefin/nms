NMS - News microservice
=======================

A Rails5 microservice implementation for Heroku.

Pretends to implements in the simplest way possible a microservice platform, considering multiple channels.

Different versions (which I hope to tag) will have incremental features, but I wont pretend to extend them too much.

There are some posts about the way this project was done, as a Rails 5 tutorial: [https://lomefin.github.io/tutorials/rails5/2016/06/17/microservicio-de-noticias-en-rails-5-parte-1.html](https://lomefin.github.io/tutorials/rails5/2016/06/17/microservicio-de-noticias-en-rails-5-parte-1.html)
